# Indeed.com-Crawler-Bot
This is a Python script that crawls through a local Indeed.com job listing and goes through each job posting, counts the number of mentions of each language and then returns the number of times each one was mentioned. I made this because I want to learn a new language for back-end programming, and I'm trying to find the most in demand language around my location.
